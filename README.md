# Master Thesis: A Virtual Reality visualization of the biosonar communication channel for live in the depths of the sea

Underwater sound propagation is used as a means of communication by many living beings in the deep sea.It is not only used as a communication channel, but it also serves so that animals can recognize the surrounding environment by acting as an underwater sonar. In this project we will visualize this phenomenon in a Virtual Reality environment and show how human noise pollution interferes with underwater life.
